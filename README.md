I learned the story of how Andrey Markov proved that there are dependent random variables. 
He argued with Pavel Nekrasov about the importance of studying dependent random variables and the Law of Large Numbers for them. 
In the process, he came up with the concept of Markov chains, and to test his marginal distribution theorem in practice, 
he took a text by Eugene Onegin, compiled a chain from it, and manually calculated all the statistics.

I thought it would be interesting to do the same thing, 
but not for letters, but for sequences of letters — tokens, and see what the resulting Markov chain can generate.

Here are some interesting and funny examples
